# L'Épreuve des Trois Cercles

An interactive quiz inspired by Pierre Bottero's *Les Mondes d'Ewilan* universe. Discover your Drawer (Dessinateur) profile through a series of questions that measure four axes: **Volonté**, **Créativité**, **Pouvoir**, and **Intégration**.

Your answers shape three overlapping circles in real time — red, blue, and yellow — whose size and overlap reflect your affinity with each dimension. At the end, you receive an archetype (Commandeur, Artiste, Sentinelle, etc.) and a character match from the books.

## Features

- Two quiz modes: **Rapide** (quick) and **Complète** (full)
- Animated three-circle Venn diagram that evolves as you answer
- Archetype determination and character similarity matching
- Shareable results via URL
- Bilingual: French and English
